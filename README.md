This python script serves just as a loader for the actual plugin since it is written in C++ and might not be directly used with Binary Ninja's plugin manager.<br>
**For full readme and source code of native sigscan plugin check out [binja_native_sigscan](https://github.com/rikodot/binja_native_sigscan).**<br>
More information about my native plugin loader can be found at [binja_native_plugin_loader](https://github.com/rikodot/binja_native_plugin_loader).
