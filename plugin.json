    "longdescription": "This plugin allows to scan analyzed binaries for signatures or create them. Supports both normal signatures (e.g. 49 28 15 ? ? 30) and commonly used code signatures (e.g. \"\\x49\\x28\\x15\\x00\\x00\\x30\", \"xxx??x\").\n\nAs title suggests, it is coded in C++ and utilizes Binary Ninja's native API. For this reason this plugin serves just as a loader for the [actual plugin](https://github.com/rikodot/binja_native_sigscan).\n\nCurrently works on Windows only!",
